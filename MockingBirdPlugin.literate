# RenderEngine Integration In Rhino With The ChangeQueue

Rhino offers a mechanism to integrate render engines. The mechanism is called
the ChangeQueue. The central idea is to provide all Rhino data in a preprocessed
form.

For instance the block definitions and their instances get handled completely
before the resulting mesh data is pushed to the client.

In this book we'll look at how one could go about integrating a new render
engine into Rhino using its RhinoCommon SDK.

We'll also see how a plug-in in general should be set up, what information is
needed. We will also be able to add some functionality during the load phase of
the plug-in.

When you get to the end of this bookation you should have a good understanding
of the Rhino plug-in base class. You will have read the entire code for a simple
render engine integration that shows the main mechanisms of the ChangeQueue from
the realtime render SDK.

## The PlugIn Implementation

The main class for the plug-in is in `<<MockingBirdPlugIn.*>>`. It derives from
`Rhino.PlugIns.RenderPlugIn` and will override two functions. The basis for the
plug-in is:

```csharp : <<MockingBirdPlugIn.*>>=
<<plugin imports>>
namespace MockingBird
{
    public class MockingBirdPlugIn : Rhino.PlugIns.RenderPlugin
    {
        <<plug-in constructor>>
        <<plug-in properties>>
        <<plug-in overrides>>
    }
}
```

### Assembly Information

For the plug-in to be a proper RHP assembly we also need to add the necessary
assembly information, which we'll do with `<<AssemblyInfo.*>>`.

```csharp : <<AssemblyInfo.*>>=
<<assembly info imports>>
<<plug-in description>>
<<assembly information>>
<<assembly GUID>>
<<plug-in version>>
```

The assembly information carries the plug-in developer information, like the
address, organization, website and so on. This information is given through the
`PlugInDescription` attribute from the `Rhino.PlugIns` namespace. The fields have
to exist, yet you need to enter only the data you really want to share. It is a
good idea to give users of your plug-in enough information for them to be able to
contact you in case they have feature requests, feedback or bug reports.

```csharp : <<plug-in description>>=
[assembly: PlugInDescription(DescriptionType.Address, "Turku")]
[assembly: PlugInDescription(DescriptionType.Country, "Finland")]
[assembly: PlugInDescription(DescriptionType.Email, "jesterking@letwory.net")]
[assembly: PlugInDescription(DescriptionType.Phone, "-")]
[assembly: PlugInDescription(DescriptionType.Fax, "-")]
[assembly: PlugInDescription(DescriptionType.Organization, "Letwory Interactive")]
[assembly: PlugInDescription(DescriptionType.UpdateUrl, "-")]
[assembly: PlugInDescription(DescriptionType.WebSite, "https://letworyinteractive.com")]
```

To be able to use the attribute we'll import `Rhino.PlugIns` here.

```csharp : <<assembly info imports>>=
using Rhino.PlugIns;
```

Apart from these developer fields the assembly needs to be tagged with the necessary
attributes. Fill out as much information as possible for completeness.

```csharp : <<assembly information>>=
[assembly: AssemblyTitle("Mocking Bird")] // Plug-In title is extracted from this
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("A sample render plug-in for Rhinoceros")]
[assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("Letwory Interactive")]
[assembly: AssemblyProduct("Mocking Bird")]
[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright Â©  2016-")]
[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCulture("")]
[assembly: ComVisible(false)]
```

These attributes need also their namespaces, so lets add them to the `<<assembly info imports>>`:

```csharp : <<assembly info imports>>=+
using System.Reflection;
using System.RuntimeCompilerServices;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
```

There are still two pieces to the plug-in assembly information we need to provide.
The first is the GUID of the plug-in. This will be used to uniquely identify
plug-ins in the Rhino eco-system. There can be only one plug-in with this GUID.
If Rhino detects multiple plug-ins with the same GUID only the first one found and
loaded will remain in Rhino, the others with the same GUID will be ignored. Rhino
**will** prompt with an error dialog.

The GUID of the plug-in has to be different from any other plug-in, so when you
create your own plug-in make sure you don't copy and paste the one used in this
book.

```csharp : <<assembly GUID>>=
[assembly: Guid("ccb6ab63-fdef-44ac-9c1f-7eca810d5b75")]
```

Finally the version number of the plug-in. This number should be bumped with each
new release.

```csharp : <<plug-in version>>=
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("0.9.1.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("0.9.1.0")]
```
### Plug-in Skeleton

We'll have a constructor added to `<<plug-in constructor>>` that sets up the singleton pattern.

```csharp : <<plug-in constructor>>=
public MockingBirdPlugIn()
{
    if(Instance == null) Instance = this;
}
```

To be able to properly construct an instance we need to have at least the
`Instance` property available. We ensure that only in an instance we can set a
new value. In our case, as seen above we do that in the constructor.

```csharp : <<plug-in properties>>=
public static MockingBirdPlugIn Instance
{
    get; private set;
}
```

At this moment we're interested in two overrides, namely `Render` and `RenderWindow`.
These are entry functions for doing a modal render. We'll start by setting this
part of the render integration up. In later chapters we'll see how to expand the
plug-in to have interactive viewport rendering capabilities.

Let is start with the `Render` override. It'll take a `RhinoDoc` instance which
will be the document to render. As second parameter there'll be a `Commands.RunMode`. This
will tell whether the `_Render` command is used interactively, i.e. the user pressed
a button, or typed the command into the Rhino command-line. Or whether it was
called in a script.

```csharp : <<plug-in overrides>>=
protected override Rhino.Commands.Result Render(RhinoDoc doc, Rhino.Commands.RunMode mode, bool fastPreview)
{
    <<modal render implementation>>
}
```

`Result` and `RunMode` come both from the `Rhino.Commands` namespace, so let's ensure
we can use them. `RhinoDoc` comes from the `Rhino` namespace.

```csharp : <<plugin imports>>=
using Rhino;
using Rhino.Commands;
```

The second override that we want to introduce at this point is `RenderWindow`. It
has the same three first parameters as `Render`, but additionally there is a `RhinoView`
for the view to render from, in case it is different from the active view. And
there is a `Rectangle` that gives the area to render from the given view. The
last bool tells us whether the rendering should happen in the viewport, or in
a separate window.


```csharp : <<plug-in overrides>>=+
protected override Rhino.Commands.Result RenderWindow(RhinoDoc doc, Rhino.Commands.RunMode mode, bool fastPreview, Rhino.Display.RhinoView view, System.Drawing.Rectangle rect, bool inWindow)
{
    <<modal render window implementation>>
}
```
